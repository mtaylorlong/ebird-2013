About three minutes later a group of six crows returned to the yard; only two of them called, both American. A minute later another crow, this one silent but presumably also American, returned.

The songs of many bird species greeted me as I exited my car. It certainly seemed like an early spring day! Titmice could be heard in a call and answer with other titmice in the park. Cardinals and chickadees joined in the chorus, too. As I took this all in, a Northern Mockingbird popped on top of a tree next to the parking lot, giving me an ideal photo-op in the rising sun's golden glow. A few steps down the dirt road produced a close-up of a Carolina Wren with a wavering call that I had not heard from this species before. The excitement died down after that and the usual inhabitants slowly checked in over the course of the remainder of the hike. Robins continued to be very active with flocks frequently moving across the sky." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -77.8019028, 43.0066986 ] } },
